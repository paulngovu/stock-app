# Stock Companion
Stock Companion is a Django web application that maintains a watch list of companies, retrieves stock prices, and makes a recommendation on how to handle that stock.

## Installation
This project is not publicly hosted, but you can clone this project and run it locally.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulngovu/stock-app.git
```

## Usage
Django is installed on a virtual environment, so we have to enable it before running the server.
```bash
source venv/Scripts/activate
python manage.py runserver
```
Go to your brower and type in `http://localhost:8000/`
